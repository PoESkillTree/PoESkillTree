List of smaller ideas/todos
===========================

Basic AdvancedSolver completion:
- use SkillTree._hybridAttributes for splitting hybrid attributes
- link tree level with generator level, generator level readonly
- AdvancedViewModel.CreateInitialAttributes: what about SkillTree.ImplicitAttributes

Basic AdvancedSolver optimization:
- better way of calculating weighting in csvs
- GeneticAlgorithm.randomBitArray() flipped bits dependent upon Total points (larger tree -> more bits set)?
- some kind of heuristic that notables (or full clusters) are generally better?
- how to handle csvs exceeding the target value? (curently they are capped at the target value) (AdvancedSolver.CalcCsv())
- optimize AdvancedSolver.FitnessFunction()
- optimize included nodes (AdvancedSolver.IncludeNode()): vicinity related steiner node selection, exclude nodes with stats that are "too far away" to be useful
- tweak AdvancedSolver.GaParameters

AdvancedSolver UI improvements:
- reset button for the Tree Generator window
- more intuitive control instead of the DataGrid
- substring match searchable ComboBox for Attributes (something like the poe.trade comboboxes)
- proper delete-row-button-icon
- inform the user that keystones must be checked if they should be included (can lead to unconnected trees if notables behind keystones are checked)

Miscellaneous:
- ControllerViewModel: get best result text from Solver or somewhere else since it is somewhat solver dependant

Bigger things (best to discuss these in GitHub issues)
=============

Extend advanced generator with pseudo attributes (tree only)

Extend advanced generator with stats like dps, life, ... (tree + gear):
- Compute.cs refactoring
Random ideas to support the UI:
- tab in the normal UI to switch between stats imported from gear and manually typed stats
- bandit support
- some way to display different skill gems, support gems (maybe), weapon types

Automatically generate constraints -> automated generator

General ideas:
- alternative solutions
- base class optimized, not specified by the user
- load base stat requirements from gear
