List of smaller ideas/todos
===========================

- Wings of Entropy pseudo attribute settings (2-hand axe + dual wield)
- Integrate 'Skill Tagged Nodes' feature into new UI completely and remove old menu entry
- test search space shrinking from http://www.zib.de/koch/biblio/paper/kochmartin1998.pdf

Bigger things (best to discuss these in GitHub issues)
=============

Extend advanced generator with stats like dps, life, ... (tree + gear):
- Compute.cs refactoring
Random ideas to support the UI:
- tab in the normal UI to switch between stats imported from gear and manually typed stats
- bandit support
- some way to display different skill gems, support gems (maybe), weapon types

Automatically generate constraints -> automated generator

General ideas:
- alternative solutions
- base class optimized, not specified by the user
- load base stat requirements from gear
