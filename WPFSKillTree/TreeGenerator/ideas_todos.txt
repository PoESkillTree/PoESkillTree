List of smaller ideas/todos
===========================

AdvancedSolver UI improvements:
- more intuitive control instead of the DataGrid: AttrConstraintGrid like PseudoConstraintGrid is done
- "Popular" group for attribute combobox
- substring match searchable ComboBox for Attributes (something like the poe.trade comboboxes)

Miscellaneous:
- more/updated Unit Tests (e.g. binary search in WeightedSampling)

Bigger things (best to discuss these in GitHub issues)
=============

Extend advanced generator with stats like dps, life, ... (tree + gear):
- Compute.cs refactoring
Random ideas to support the UI:
- tab in the normal UI to switch between stats imported from gear and manually typed stats
- bandit support
- some way to display different skill gems, support gems (maybe), weapon types

Automatically generate constraints -> automated generator

General ideas:
- alternative solutions
- base class optimized, not specified by the user
- load base stat requirements from gear
